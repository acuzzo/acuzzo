Entry-level data scientist professional: I’m a self-motivated, adaptable, and dedicated individual, with a passion for learning and innovation. Having gained wide ranging experience from teaching to regenerative farming I wish to use these insights and life experience, coupled with my academic background to pursue a career in research and data analytics. I possess a curious mind with an ability to think objectively and this is reflected in my multidisciplined, multidimensional approach to subject matter analysis.
